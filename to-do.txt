- Room init
	- structure
	- room-isolation
	- connections
- Lighting
	- probably forget about lightmapping at this point (too many caveats)
	- room-isolation should help keep lights-per-frame low



- Solution for current issues w light
	- Manual segmentation of rooms into sections
	- Each section will have independent lights
	- Multiple final-pass shaders for any N lights in the section
